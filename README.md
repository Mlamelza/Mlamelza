### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Melissa Lamelza and I am an aspiring full-stack developer, with a passion for the arts as well! I enjoy the challenge of learning new programming languages, creating web applications, and I have a weird obsession with relational database design. I also have a background in graphic design, which allows me the opportunity to create aesthetically pleasing solutions in order to successfully communicate thoughts, ideas, and information via visual conceptualization.
